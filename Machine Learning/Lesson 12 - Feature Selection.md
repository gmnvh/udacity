# Lesson 12 - Feature Selection

- select best features
- add new features

- A new Enron feature
	- use my human intuition
	- code up the new feature
	- visualize
	- repeat

- Why might you want to ignore a feature
	- noisy
	- causes over fitting
	- strongly related (highly correlated) with a feature that's already present
	- slow down training/testing
	
- regularization - balancing error with number of points
