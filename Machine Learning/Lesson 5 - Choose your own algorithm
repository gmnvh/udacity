# Lesson 5 - Choose your own algorithm

This  lesson is a mini project where you have to choose between 3 algorithms to
study on your own

- k nearest neighboars
- random forest
- adaboost

### Adaboost

Short for Adaptive Boosting. It is a combination of weak learners.  The individual
learners can be weak, but as long as the performance of each one is slightly better
than random guessing, the final model can be proven to converge to a strong learner.

- [x] research/understand algorithms
- [x] get it running in sklearn
- [x] run it on the terrain classification data
- [x] quantify accuracy
