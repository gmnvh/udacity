# Lesson 10 - Feature scaling

- Feature scaling: pre processing the data before apply machine learning
- Important if the numbers for each feature is to different from each other
- Feature scaling will equally weight the features so they are always in some same range usually between 0 and 1

- x' = (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin)

- Disadvantage: Outliers can mess up your scaling
