# Lesson 3 - SVM

 - Support Vector Machines
 - Margin = Maximizes distance to nearest point
 - [x] Download quiz 12 and run in the pc
    - Accuracy for quiz 12 - SVM for terrain : 0.92
 - Effect of gamma and C for rbf SVMs (Quiz 22)
    - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_rbf_parameters.html
    - Besides the fact that the answer is that a large C should get more points correct. When printing the accuracy for C=1 and C=1000. C=1 has a better one if gamma is big. If gamma is 1 and C is 1000, the accurancy is 0.9399. The best one tried so far.
