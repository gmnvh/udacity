	Purpose: implements a 2-dimensional histogram filter
	for a robot living on a colored cyclical grid by 
	correctly implementing the "initialize_beliefs", 
	"sense", and "move" functions.

	This file is incomplete! Your job is to make these
	functions work. Feel free to look at localizer.py 
	for working implementations which are written in python.

    0.00  1.00  0.00
    0.00  0.00  0.00

         the robot's beliefs for each cell before sensing. For 
         example, a robot which has almost certainly localized 
         itself in a 2D world might have the following beliefs:

           is. If blurring = 0.0 then motion is noiseless.
