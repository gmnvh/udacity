    "`run_search` - This does a lot of the legwork to run search once you've implemented everything else below. First, it checks whether the map, goal and start have been added to the class. Then, it will also check if the other variables, other than `path` are initialized (note that these are only needed to be re-run if the goal or start were not originally given when initializing the class, based on what we discussed above for `__init__`.\n",

If we're at our goal, we reconstruct the path. If not, we move our current node from the frontier (`openSet`) and into explored (`closedSet`). Then, we check out the neighbors of the current node, check out their costs, and plan our next move.\n",
